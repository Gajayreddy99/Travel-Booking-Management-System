# Travel-Booking-Management-System
The CVTrip Booking System lets users sign up/login with OTP, choose a service provider (AbhiBus, RedBus, Goibibo, MakeMyTrip, Booking.com), and book Bus, Train, or Flight tickets. Users enter travel details, fares are calculated (base fare + discount + GST + service charge), payment is processed via OTP, and booking is confirmed.
